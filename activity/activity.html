					<h1>Front-end Developer or Back-end Developer?</h1>
					<p>I prefer to pursue a career as a Backend Developer because it allows me to engage with core logic and databases, aligning with my more analytical mindset rather than a creative one. This role focuses on establishing the foundational elements of applications, including databases, servers, and APIs, which are in high demand within the tech industry. Additionally, as Sir Gelo noted, many full-stack developers primarily come from a backend development background, often possessing only a basic understanding of the frontend.</p>

						<h2>Web 1.0</h2>
						<p>The Static Web — In the early days, the internet consisted primarily of static web pages. This era, known as Web 1.0 or the "Read-Only Web," was characterized by content that users could view but not engage with. Websites resembled digital brochures, offering information without the dynamic interactivity we have come to expect from today's internet.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="card">
						<h2>Web 2.0</h2>
						<p>The Social Web — known as the "Read-Write Web," transformed user interaction with the internet by allowing individuals to both consume and create content. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube democratized publishing, empowering users to share their voices. This era emphasized collaboration and community-building, laying the foundation for the next phase of internet evolution.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="card">
						<h2>Web 3.0</h2>
						<p>The Semantic and Decentralized Web — known as Read-Write-Execute Web, where the internet understands context and meaning. This new version of the web focuses on understanding rather than just data. It uses smart technology and decentralized systems to create an environment where machines can understand what users need and respond easily. This change breaks down barriers and opens the door to amazing innovations.</p>

					<h1>Is a wordpress "developer" a developer?</h1>

					<p>Yes, Wordpress developers are real developers. While some of them may not write code from scratch, they still require problem-solving skills, technical knowledge, and attention to detail necessary to configure, customize, and develop websites. Development goes beyond just coding; it focuses on identifying issues, crafting solutions, and providing value to users. This might mean writing original code or utilizing established tools and platforms like WordPress.</p>
